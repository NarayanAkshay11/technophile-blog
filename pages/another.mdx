# Autonomous Systems Learning Path

## Topics to Cover

Robotic Operation System (ROS), Python & C++ (for OOPs), C(depending on the hardware requirements), Hardware Specifics (Arduino, RPI, GPU)

## Starting from base?

Define the scope of the system. Start with system level diagrams and design to understand how communication and control work.
