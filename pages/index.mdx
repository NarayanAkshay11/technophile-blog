# Hiyaa
 
Welcome to my blog! I'm an anonymous student at Nanyang Technological University and I have this blog + documentation website to help my peers in case they also want to work in
the same boring field as me.

## What's in the blog?

Every step I take to setup a **startup** from scratch to become a **Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthrophist** (if you don't get this, please leave).

## Documentation

Everything from ROS, Kernel Programming, AOSP, ML Achievemebts and even rare attempts at Web Development.

## Fun Fact

Had you visited this site a bit earlier, you'd have known my identity.
