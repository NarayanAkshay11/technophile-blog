### Wassup Motherfleckers
I'm a random anonymous student in NTU, enjoying what many seem to hate, computer engineering. With strong motivations to ensure CCDS starts giving more importance to CE, I'm doing a ton of stuff and am documenting this just in case the future deems it necessary, like in HIMYM.
But, if any of my so called "readers" wish to learn something from this, be my guest.

But if anyone ever asks why I'm better - You like to lose small but I like to win big - that's why ;)
